The testcases for the Travel Agent project are available in
TravelAgent-finaltests-21.lisp

Please do the following to execute the test cases for the
Travel Agent project and submit your results; note that dribble
is a Lisp function that sends everything that appears on the screen
to the named file

1. Create a file of output for the testcases by doing the following:
   invoke sbcl
   (dribble "TravelAgent-output")
   (load "TravelAgent-setup-21.lisp")
   (database-setup)
   (load "<your-file-of-code-for-TravelAgent>")
   (load "TravelAgent-finaltests-21.lisp")
   (testing)
   (dribble)

2. Check your file TravelAgent-output to make sure that it contains
   the results of executing the testcases.

3. Upload the following to Canvas:
   A. your file of code for the Travel Agent problem
   B. your file TravelAgent-output that was produced by executing
      the testcases with your Travel Agent code
